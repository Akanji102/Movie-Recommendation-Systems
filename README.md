# Movie-Recommendation-Systems
I built a Movie Recommendation system using cosine similarity, I was able to lay my hands on a very robust movie dataset, I performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing. 

This project strenghtened my python skills and also improved my knowledge of cosine similarity and general machine learning knowledge. 

However, I noticed that some of the recommendations are actually not perfect. For example, "To Kill A Mockingbird" A popular and intensed courtroom movie/novel was recommended alongside with action-movies, this shows that the recommendation system is not perfect, I do hope to learn more in the nearest future and improve and also improve my coding skills as well.

Thanks for sticking around.
